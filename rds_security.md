### RDS - Security

- KMS encryption at rest for underlying EBS volumes / snapshots
- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for Oracle and SQL Server
- SSL encryption to RDS is possible for all DB (in-flight)
- IAM authentication for MySQL, PostgreSQL and MariaDB
- Authorization still happens within RDS (not in IAM)
- Can copy an un-encrypted RDS snapshot into an encrypted one
- CloudTrail cannot be used to track queries made within RDS
